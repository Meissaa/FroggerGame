# FroggerGame

Frogger is a game in which the player is to help the frog named Frogger cross the street and the other side of the river.
The street is a multi-lane highway where cars move at different speeds. Turtles and logs of various sizes flow on the river.
Frogger must collect all five small frogs, one by one, in the order chosen by the player. The game is on time, which means 
that when the player collects all small frogs, he can sign up to the players' ranking.
